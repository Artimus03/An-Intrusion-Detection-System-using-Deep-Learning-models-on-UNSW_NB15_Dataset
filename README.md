 # A Deep Learning Based Intrusion Detection System for IIoT Networks

In recent years, the advancements in the network and cloud technologies have led to the growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) in industrial sectors. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) comprises many connected devices and service data. IIoT networks are inherently vulnerable to cyberattacks as they depend on the associated networks for data exchange and communication. Therefore, it accentuates the necessity for ensuring the security of the IIoT systems for uninterrupted services. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are widely adopted as a promising solution to detect cyber threats and attacks on the Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and IIoT networks. The existing IDS approaches lack generalisation, and involve misclassification errors and high false alarm rates. Considering these issues, a “Hybrid CNN + LSTM”, deep learning-based IDS is designed to identify malicious activities from IIoT networks. The proposed “CNN + LSTM” employs a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to identify the attack events and regular operations. The experiments are carried out using a benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15 and the outcomes demonstrate the dominance of the proposed approach by achieving higher accuracy for the datasets respectively.

 # CONVOLUTIONAL NEURALNETWORK
 
The CNN is a type of feed-forward neural network designed to extract hierarchical and spatial information from data. In the context of the UNSW-NB15 dataset, CNN is employed to analyze and classify the different attacks. During training, the model learns from input data by defining a set of filter values that enable it to recognize patterns and features within the input data. These filters systematically scan the input data, extracting relevant information at different layers of the network. As the input data passes through the layers, the network adjusts its weights through backpropagation, minimizing errors and refining itsability to classify network traffic accurately. By using convolutional filters to map parts of the input data with varying window sizes and strides, CNN efficiently captures features within the input data. This hierarchical feature extraction process makes CNN well-suited for tasks such as classifying network traffic into different categories based on its characteristics.

# LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY

The LSTM network is a type of Recurrent Neural network (RNN) designed to process and classify sequential data, such as time series or natural language text. In the context of the UNSW NB15 dataset, LSTM networks are utilized to analyze and classify various attacks.During training, the LSTM model learns from input sequences by dynamically updating its memory cells, which enables it to capture long-term dependencies and temporal patterns within the data. Unlike traditional RNNs, LSTM networks incorporate gated mechanisms that regulate the flow of information through the network, allowing them to retain information over extended time periods and mitigate the vanishing gradient problem. The LSTM networkoperates by processing input sequences step by step, with each step updating its internal state based on the current input and the previous state. This process enables the network to learn intricate patterns and relationships within the sequential data. Through backpropagation, the network adjusts its parameters, including the weights and biases of the gates, to minimizeerrors and optimize its ability to classify network traffic accurately.

# HYBRID CNN+LSTM MODEL

A hybrid CNN-LSTM model combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks to analyze and classify sequential data such as network traffic, as seen in the context of the UNSW-NB15 dataset. This model architecture integrates the hierarchical feature extraction capabilities of CNNs with the ability of LSTMs to capture long-term dependencies and temporal patterns within sequential data. During training, the hybrid model leverages CNN layers to extract spatial features from theinput data, such as patterns and structures within the network traffic. These CNN layers consist of convolutional filters that systematically scan the input data, capturing relevant information at different levels of abstraction. The output of the CNN layers is then passed to the LSTM layers, which process the sequential data over time steps. Within the LSTM layers, the model dynamically updates its memory cells based on the sequential input, allowing it to capture both short-term and long-term dependencies within the data. The gated mechanisms within the LSTM architecture regulate the flow of information, enabling the model to retain important contextual information over extended periods. Through the joint training of both CNN-based and LSTM-based components, the hybrid model learns to effectively classify network traffic into different categories based on its characteristics. As the input data passes through the layers, the model adjusts its parameters through backpropagation, optimizing its ability to accurately classify various types of network attacks.
